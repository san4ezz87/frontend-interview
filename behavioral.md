## **Q: Can you describe your day?**

**Notes:**

You can try to help a bit with your example, but not much. Look for recurring events, calls, time when he writes code. How he split a day, to solve some blockers.

## **Q: You got a task with a poor description, what are you going to do?**

**Notes:**

If he says that he will ask to describe it better, say it is not possible. Check reaction. Good to see if he starts searching for solution. Also you can ask what exactly he was doing last time he was in the situation.

## **Q: Where do you get information, how you study? Ask to remember something recent and specific.**
