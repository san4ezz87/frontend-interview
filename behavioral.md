# Behavioral Questions

## **Q: Can you describe your day?**

**Notes:**

You can try to help a bit with your example, but not much. Look for recurring events, calls, time when he writes code. How he split a day, to solve some blockers.

---

## **Q: You got a task with a poor description, what are you going to do?**

**Notes:**

If he says that he will ask to describe it better, say it is not possible. Check reaction. Good to see if he starts searching for solution. Also you can ask what exactly he was doing last time he was in the situation.

## **Q: Where do you get information, how you study? Ask to remember something recent and specific.**

---

**Note:**

Don't reveal the "chaotic environment" explanation before the candidate answers. Let them respond based on their natural mindset first.

After they give their answer, you can clarify that:

> "We work in a fast-moving, sometimes chaotic environment where priorities shift and not everything is clearly defined. We need someone proactive who can handle ambiguity, solve non-technical problems, and bring clarity."

This allows you to see their real approach, and only then check if they can adjust once they understand the context.

## **Q: You got a task and it hasn't been discussed yet. But it's well described. When you started work on it, it seems to you that something is wrong. What are your actions?**

**Check for:**

## **Q: You have a task and it isn't clear, you need to sort things out and you have tight deadline. Your junior colleague came to you and ask for help and you need to study this task to help him. What are you going to do?**

**Check for:**

- ✅ Good: Clarifies priorities — understands his own deadlines and checks whether the junior is truly blocked.
- ✅ Good: Helps when possible — if the unblock is quick or low-effort, he assists immediately to keep the team moving.
- ✅ Good: Communicates properly — if the help requires more time, he informs both the junior and the manager about the priority conflict and agrees on a plan.
- ✅ Good: Focuses on impact — ensures neither his task nor the junior's task gets stalled; chooses the action that minimizes overall project risk.
- ❌ Bad: Refuses to help without assessing the situation.
- ❌ Bad: Escalates to the manager as the first reaction instead of taking ownership.
- ❌ Bad: Redirects the junior randomly without ensuring they will actually get support.
