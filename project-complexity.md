# Project Complexity Questions

---

## **Q: Can you choose one or a few technical challenges that you had? It might be one complex project or features from a few.**

**Notes:**

- Pay attention to general project complexity
- It's okay if they worked in a strong team but weren't leading
- You can help them a bit with your example, but not too much. It might be difficult for them to come up with something from scratch

**Follow-up:**

1. **Q: Why was it difficult?**

   **Notes:**

   - Environment reasons are also valid (e.g., task wasn't clear, tight deadlines)
   - Our liveops was challenging not only technically - you need to analyze
   - We had an example but didn't have qualification at that time

2. **Q: If you feel that you know this sort of problem, try to clarify solutions that they made. If the solution is bad and they know it, ask why it was left this way.**

   **Check for:**

   - ✅ Good: If business forced them, ask if they managed to persuade business to improve the solution
   - ❌ Bad: If they just accepted a bad solution without trying to improve it
